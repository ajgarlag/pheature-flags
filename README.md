# Pheature Flags

Hi there! Thanks for being aware of our project :wave: . We are a group of web industry professionals who want to learn,
grow and enjoy doing our jobs a better place. We’re excited that you’re here to learn more about and grow together :wink: . 

Pheature flags is a collection of small libraries made to create a complete software releasing management system, 
allowing both managers and developers to put code in production only to specific audience,
rolling back a failing feature with a switch button, [creating your own rollout strategies](), also helps to decrease 
the technical debt on applying complex business experiments, and so on.

Our main goal is to build trust between developers and stakeholders involved in a successful software releasing process.
